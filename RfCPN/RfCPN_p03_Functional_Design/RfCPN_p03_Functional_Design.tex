\tPart{機械の稼働における\index{きのうせっけい@機能設計}機能設計\TBW}{%
\paragraph*{\tpartgoal}
新たな横型マシニングセンタの稼働に向けて、\index{システムせっけい@システム設計}システム設計（\index{きのうせっけい@機能設計}機能設計）を行う。

\tcbline*
\paragraph*{\tpartmethod}
特定された\index{ようけん@要件}要件を基に、\index{きのうせっけい@機能設計}機能設計を行う。

\tcbline*
\paragraph*{\tpartbackground}
先にも述べたとおり、\index{システムかいはつプロセスのけいかく@システム開発プロセスの計画}システム開発プロセスの計画は白紙状態であるが、とにかく稼働をさせ生産のできる状態にすることが喫緊の課題である。

　その一環として、前段階の特定された\index{ようけん@要件}要件を用いて、機械の稼働における\index{きのうせっけい@機能設計}機能設計を速やかに行う必要がある。
