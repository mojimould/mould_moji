\modHeadsection{引数の指定}
\index{ひきすう@引数}引数の指定の仕方は2通りある。
ここではそれらを\index{ひきすうしてい@引数指定}引数指定Iおよび引数指定IIと呼ぶことにする。


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% subsection 10.4.1 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{引数指定I}
\index{ひきすうしていI@引数指定I}引数指定Iでは、引数アドレスとしてA-Zのアルファベットをそれぞれ1回ずつ用いることができる。
そのため使用できる引数の数は、アルファベットの数(26個)である。
ただし、通常はG, L, N, O, Pは用いることができず、実質的に21個が使用可能な数である。


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% subsection 10.4.1 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{引数指定II}
\index{ひきすうしていII@引数指定II}引数指定IIでは、引数アドレスとしてA, B, Cを1回とI, J, Kを10組まで用いることができる。
そのため使用できる引数の数は、33個である。

A, B, Cにはそれぞれ\ttNum1, \ttNum2, \ttNum3が割り当てられ、I, J, Kは入力の順序でマクロの\ttNum4から順番に\ttNum33まで割り当てられる。

原則として、引数の数が22個以上必要でない限り、\DMname では引数指定Iを用いるものとする。\\
