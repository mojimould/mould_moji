したがって、工具の切削部の先端、および切削部の厚みを測定し、切削部の先端から厚みの半分の値を引いた値を\index{こうぐちょうほせいち@工具長補正値}工具長補正値とする。
なお、このとき工具長の\index{まもうりょう（こうぐちょうほせい）@摩耗量（工具長補正）}摩耗量は0とする。

\end{align*}
とする。
ここで$w'_{\mathrm A0}$, $w'_{\mathrm Aq}$は（\PlatingThk$\mu$を考慮した）トップ端におけるAC方向の内径およびトップ端から距離$q$におけるAC方向の内径を示し、$R_\mathrm c$, $f_\mathrm T$はそれぞれ\CenterCurvatureRadius, \TopAlocationLength を示す。

ただし、$\phi < 0$となる場合は、$\phi = 0$とみなすものとする。
