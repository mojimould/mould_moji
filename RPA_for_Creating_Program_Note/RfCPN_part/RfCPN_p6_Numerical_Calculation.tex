\paragraph*{目標（なにがしたいか？）}
\index{めいさい（モールド）@明細（モールド）}明細ごとに異なる\index{すんぽう@寸法}寸法・形状を持つすべての\index{モールド}モールドに対し、\index{プログラム}プログラムの作成に必要な\textbf{数値情報および条件分岐情報等が自動的に得られるシステムを構築}する。
\tcbline*
\paragraph*{手段（どうやって？）}
前段階で導出した\textbf{解析的な情報}を用いて、各明細における具体的な\textbf{数値的な情報}に変換するシステムの構築を試みる。
\tcbline*
\paragraph*{背景（なぜ？）}
一般に、個々の製品や\index{こうぐ@工具}工具等の寸法は異なり、明細ごとに固有の寸法・形状を持つ。
プログラムの作成の際には、それらをすべて考慮した\textbf{具体的な数値情報}を指定する必要がある。

　こうした数値情報は\textbf{明細ごとに膨大にある}が、現時点（\DMname 設置時点）において、こうした手続きは\textbf{明細ごとに手作業}で行われている
%% footnote %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\footnote{さらには、「\index{ずめん（モールド）@図面（モールド）}図面の作成後、それを見て\index{プログラム}プログラムを作成する」という明らかに異常な（奇妙な）事態が放置され続けている。}。
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

　したがって、こうした手続きのシステム化を行い、可能な限り\textbf{自動化}することが喫緊の課題である。
そうすることで、\textbf{危険を伴う作業の削減（\index{あんぜんせい@安全性}安全性の向上）}や、\textbf{品質の低下の防止}に大きく寄与できることが期待される。
また副次的効果として、作業効率・人的資源・安全(security)・\index{ほしゅ@保守}保守などのいずれの観点からみた\textbf{能率の低下の防止}にも大きく貢献することも自ずと期待される。
\tcbline*
\paragraph*{結論（どうなった？）}
各明細のモールドにおける固有数値情報の入力により、プログラムの作成に必要な数値情報および条件分岐情報等が（人による手動計算を介することなく）自動的に得られるシステムを構築した。
