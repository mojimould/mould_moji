This document was created using \TeX{} (\linkLaTeX\kern.15em2$_{\textstyle\varepsilon}$), specifically utilizing tools such as \linkTeXLive{} 2023, up\LaTeX, \linkBibLaTeX\ (\linkBiber), \linkupmendex, \linkPGFTikZ, and many useful packages.\\
The document was edited using \linkTeXStudio{} and \linkSumatraPDF.\\
Numerical calculations were performed using \linkExcel{} and \linkPython.\\
The source codes for the G-code programs were written using \linkVSCode.\\
Version and issue control for these documents were managed using \linkGitHub.\\
%The environment for these tools was managed using \linkDocker{} and \linkUbuntu.\\
%The database used was \linkSQLite.\\
Thanks to these tools, with the all-around support of \linkChatGPT-4 (\linkMicrosoftCopilot), the creation of the document and system was made possible,
even while navigating solo and finding my way in the quiet corners.
